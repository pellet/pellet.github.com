Videohog is back on the iOS AppStore, I will continue to add features to it and get it running as smooth as possible.


The Mac version of Videohog Free will be updated soon to include a 'turbo' mode which gives the user the ability to run the transfer at a higher speed for up to a minute as to give some insight into the speed increase of using Videohog for video file transfers.
