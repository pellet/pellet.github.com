The full version has been updated on the mac appstore.
Unfortunately the Halloween ghouls and ghosts have attacked the software and caused it to crash.  It crashes when during transfer only after using the advanced transfer settings panel.  For now please just use the standard transfer settings panel until the bug fix has been pushed onto the appstore by Apple.  I have requested an expediate update to fix this show stopping bug.
