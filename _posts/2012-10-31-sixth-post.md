Many thanks to Apple for their quick response and review of this version to fix the previous version's bug.

The bug which was crashing the app on using advanced transfer settings is now fixed.  I have also included a fix for videohog files which have been copied between computers.

New features such as the ability to drag the window by any component other than a button and the ability to play videohog files from the main panel such as when the transfer has completed.
